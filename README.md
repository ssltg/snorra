This Webpage is designed to help translate Valkyrie scenarios.
It`s currently in Alpha State, so don't rely on the functionality and backup your progress often. (nothing is more frustrating then an evening of work for the trashbin). So I repeat "SAVE OFTEN".

With this tool you can easily translate Valkyrie Localizations (or any other comma separated snippet files).

You can just upload or paste your source language localization file and start translating to your destination language.
If everything is finished, you can export the results to your new localization file.
